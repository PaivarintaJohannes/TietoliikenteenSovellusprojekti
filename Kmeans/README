# K-Means Algorithm

## Overview

This script demonstrates the K-Means algorithm, used for grouping data points into K clusters. The algorithm iteratively refines cluster centers based on the average position of data points within each cluster.

## Usage

1. **Data Loading:** The script loads a dataset from the 'putty.log' file. Ensure the file is available and formatted correctly.

2. **Initialization:** Random cluster centers are initialized within the data space.

3. **Clustering:** The K-Means algorithm is applied iteratively for a set number of times (100 in this case). It calculates distances between data points and cluster centers, assigns points to the nearest cluster, and updates the cluster centers.

4. **Visualization:** The results are visualized in a 3D plot using matplotlib. The calculated cluster centers are shown in green, the initial random points in blue, and the data points in red.
